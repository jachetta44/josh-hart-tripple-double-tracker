</p>

## 🚨 What is this?
This is a fully-automated GitHub Actions bot that wakes up every Knicks game night and asks the universe:

> **“Did Josh Hart do something ridiculous again?”**

If he did — meaning Josh secured a triple-double — it blasts the news onto Twitter (X) with sirens, hype, and unreasonable enthusiasm.

If he *didn’t* get a triple-double?  
The bot respectfully whispers the stats and goes back to sleep.  
Like a disappointed but supportive uncle.

## 🧠 How It Works
Every 10 minutes (during the sacred Josh Hart window — 10pm to 1am ET), this bot:

1. Checks if the Knicks played today  
2. Checks if the game is final  
3. Checks if Josh Hart casually dropped 10+ in three categories  
4. Tweets either:  
   - **A fully unhinged triple-double celebration**, OR  
   - A polite “not tonight, king” stat summary  

It uses:

- **GitHub Actions** → To run itself for free  
- **balldontlie.io** → For game + stats data  
- **Twitter/X API** → To tweet the gospel of Josh Hart  

No server.  
No open laptop.  
No electricity bill spike.  
Just pure basketball automation.

## 🏀 Why Josh Hart?
Because Josh Hart is a menace to box scores.

He rebounds like he's 7'2".  
He passes like he's allergic to not passing.  
He scores when he feels like it.  
He once had a triple-double in the playoffs *while doing everything everywhere all at once.*

Honestly, he should be illegal.
